Data extraction: Cloning the Github using script to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and storing it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.

Data transformation: Using a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

Database insertion: Using the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

Dashboard creation: Using the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions are used to display the data on a map and Streamlit is used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

Data retrieval: Using the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Using the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.

This approach leverages the power of Python and its numerous libraries to extract, transform, and analyze data, and to create a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing the insights obtained from the data.
